### 4.5. The "Crystal" Collectibles (Procedural Art)

* **Concept:** Replace preview cards with generated aesthetic crystals.
* **The Seed System:** An 8-digit seed (e.g., `00004444`) determines the look.
* **Quadrants:** 4 sectors, each with random point values/shapes.
* **Cracks/Flaws:** Overlay textures that can align to form shapes (hearts, skulls, etc.) or just look cool.
* **Rarity:** "Clean" crystals vs. specific matching patterns.

### 4.75. Extra Options
* **Model:** choose a model. temperature, top P, top K, etc
* **Host:** kick user, promote user to host
* **NPC:** create or delete npc. halt npc generation
* **Archive:** Delete/archive session.

### 4.78 Syntax Parsing
* `<Thoughts>`: Visible to user (grey/italics), hidden from other characters.
* `~Whisper~`: Targeted message parsing so only specific characters hear it.

## 4.83 Linked characters

### 4.875. Node map

* **Area:** a map for areas in the chat creation
* **location:** a map for locations in the background gallery when making an area.


* **Implementation:** A custom View or layered ImageView that constructs the crystal at runtime based on the character's hash or a random ID.

### 5. The Ecosystem (Long Term)

* **AI VTT:** Battlemaps and inventory.
* **VN Studio:** Asset generation tools.
* **World Builder:** Map creation logic.
